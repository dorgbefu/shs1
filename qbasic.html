    <h2>QBASIC Basics</h2>
    <p>
      QBASIC is a simple yet powerful programming language that provides a structured approach to programming. Some QBASIC basics include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>QBASIC uses an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing and running programs.</li>
      <li>It consists of an editor for writing code, a compiler for converting code into machine-readable form, and a debugger for identifying and fixing errors.</li>
      <li>The IDE provides a user-friendly interface with various features, such as syntax highlighting and code suggestions.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="topic">
    <h2>Structure of a QBASIC Program</h2>
    <p>
      A QBASIC program consists of statements, keywords, and comments. The structure is as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Statements:</strong> QBASIC programs are composed of statements that perform specific actions. Each statement ends with a line number or a colon (:).</li>
      <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> QBASIC has a set of reserved words called keywords that have predefined meanings. These keywords cannot be used as variable names.</li>
      <li><strong>Comments:</strong> Comments are used to add explanations or notes within the code. They are ignored by the compiler and are enclosed in single quotes (').</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="topic">
    <h2>Variables and Data Types</h2>
    <p>
      QBASIC supports various data types to store different kinds of values. Commonly used data types include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Integer:</strong> Used to store whole numbers without decimal places.</li>
      <li><strong>Floating-point:</strong> Used to store numbers with decimal places.</li>
      <li><strong>String:</strong> Used to store textual data or a sequence of characters.</li>
      <li><strong>Boolean:</strong> Used to store logical values (True or False).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="topic">
    <h2>Input and Output Operations</h2>
    <p>
      QBASIC provides several statements for input and output operations. Some commonly used statements are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>PRINT:</strong> Used to display output on the screen.</li>
      <li><strong>INPUT:</strong> Used to receive input from the user.</li>
      <li><strong>READ:</strong> Used to read data from a data file.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
<div class="topic">
    <h2>QBASIC Control Structures</h2>
    <p>
      Control structures in QBASIC allow you to control the flow of execution in a program. Some common control structures include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Decision-making:</strong> The IF...THEN...ELSE statements are used to make decisions based on certain conditions. They allow the program to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.</li>
      <li><strong>Looping:</strong> QBASIC provides two main loop structures: FOR...NEXT and DO...LOOP. The FOR...NEXT loop repeats a block of code for a specified number of times, while the DO...LOOP loop repeats a block of code until a specified condition is met.</li>
      <li><strong>Selective execution:</strong> The SELECT CASE statement provides a way to execute different blocks of code based on the value of an expression. It is useful when you have multiple conditions to check.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
   <div class="topic">
    <h2>Subroutines and Functions</h2>
    <p>
      Subroutines and functions are reusable blocks of code in QBASIC that allow you to perform specific tasks. Here are some key points about subroutines and functions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Creating and using subroutines:</strong> Subroutines are defined using the SUB...END SUB statement. They are used to group related code and make it reusable. You can call a subroutine using the CALL statement.</li>
      <li><strong>Passing parameters to subroutines and returning values:</strong> Subroutines can accept parameters, which are values passed to them for processing. They can also return values using the FUNCTION statement. Parameters and return values allow for more flexibility and functionality in your programs.</li>
      <li><strong>Built-in QBASIC functions for mathematical calculations:</strong> QBASIC provides various built-in functions for performing mathematical calculations. These functions include ABS, SQR, SIN, COS, and more. They can be used to perform common mathematical operations within your programs.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="topic">
    <h2>Arrays and Data Handling</h2>
    <p>
      Arrays are data structures that allow you to store multiple values of the same data type. Here are some key points about arrays and data handling in QBASIC:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Introduction to arrays and their uses:</strong> Arrays are used to store collections of data in a single variable. They are useful when you need to work with multiple related values. QBASIC supports one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.</li>
      <li><strong>Manipulating array elements:</strong> You can access, modify, and search for specific elements in an array using their indexes. QBASIC provides various array-related functions and statements, such as LBOUND, UBOUND, and the FOR EACH...NEXT loop, to work with arrays effectively.</li>
      <li><strong>File handling:</strong> QBASIC allows you to handle files, including opening, reading, writing, and closing files. File handling operations are essential when you need to store or retrieve data from external files.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="topic">
    <h2>Problem Solving and Debugging</h2>
    <p>
      Problem-solving and debugging are crucial skills in programming. Here are some key points related to problem-solving and debugging in QBASIC:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Developing algorithms and flowcharts for problem-solving:</strong> Before writing code, it is important to analyze the problem, design an algorithm, and create a flowchart. These steps help you plan and visualize the solution before implementing it.</li>
      <li><strong>Identifying and fixing common programming errors:</strong> While writing code, it is common to encounter errors such as syntax errors, logical errors, and runtime errors. Understanding how to identify and fix these errors is crucial for writing functional programs.</li>
      <li><strong>Testing and debugging programs:</strong> Testing involves running your program with various inputs to verify its correctness. Debugging involves locating and fixing errors in your code. QBASIC provides tools such as breakpoints and step-by-step execution to assist in the debugging process.</li>
    </ul>
